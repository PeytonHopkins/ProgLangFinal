    For this project, I started out with Python as I had more experience and confidence using it compared to COOL.
My strategy was to get the algorithm figured out and implemented using Python and then use that knowledge and experience
to implement it in COOL.
    COOL was by far the hardest due to it not having all of the functionality of python. I had to manually code lists.
Also, it was much more difficult to do routine tasks like looping or accessing data from classes. My strategy for both
implementations was to organize every 2 lines into a node, and then sort those nodes using an approach similar to topological
sorting.
